# Check Recovery Email and Phone

Google uses an email address and/or a phone number to help recover your account in case of authentication issue. The email address is also used to inform the user of any security related event. It is important to check these values to be sure that an attacker did not change them to have the possibility to recover access to the account later.

To do this, go to the following pages :
